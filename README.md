# Image Color Segmentation

This project demonstrates how to segment and modify colors in an image using OpenCV and Python. It allows users to upload an image, identify specific regions based on color ranges, and modify the colors for visualization.

## Features
- Upload an image in Google Colab.
- Identify walls and floors based on predefined RGB color ranges.
- Modify the colors of walls and floors in the image.
- Save and download the modified image.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mhasifm/Image-Color-Segmentation.git
   cd Image-Color-Segmentation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the script in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload an image when prompted.
3. Modify the RGB color ranges in the script based on your image.
4. Run the script to process the image and download the modified version.
